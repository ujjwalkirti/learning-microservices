# Microservices in Multiple Languages

This repository is a collection of microservices implementations built across different programming languages and frameworks. Each project demonstrates how to architect and build the same service functionality using various tech stacks, making it an excellent resource for:

- **Learning microservices architecture** and design patterns
- **Comparing different languages and frameworks** (Node.js, Rust, Go, Java, etc.)
- **Understanding trade-offs** between performance, developer experience, and ecosystem maturity
- **Exploring best practices** for building scalable, maintainable services
- **Building real-world applications** like Learning Management Systems, APIs, and distributed systems

## Projects

### 📚 LMS (Learning Management System)
A comprehensive multi-language implementation of a Learning Management System with:
- User authentication and authorization
- Course and content management
- Analytics and progress tracking
- Previous Year Questions (PYQs) management

See [lms/README.md](./lms/README.md) for details.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the project folder you're interested in (e.g., `cd lms`)
2. Follow the README in that directory for language-specific setup instructions
3. Each microservice runs on a different port and can be deployed independently

## Why Multiple Languages?

Building the same service in different languages helps you:
- Understand core microservices principles that transcend language choices
- Evaluate which language best suits your performance and scalability needs
- Learn idiomatic patterns in different ecosystems
- Make informed decisions for your production systems
